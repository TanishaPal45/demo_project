                    Missile Man of India
                </h2>
                <p>
                   <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,</b> better known as APJ Abdul Kalam, was an illustrious scientist turned statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam spent more than forty years as a science administrator and scientist mainly at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Defence Research and the Development Organization (DRDO). He was closely associated with the military missile development efforts and civilian space programme of India. For his work on launch vehicle technology and development of ballistic missile, he was given the pseudonym of ‘The Missile Man of India.’ In 1998, he played a prominent role in Pokhran-II Nuclear Tests.

In 2002, he was elected the 11th President of the country and became widely known as the ‘People’s President.’ After serving his presidential term he pursued what he loved most – teaching, writing and reading. For his achievements and contributions as a scientist, he was honoured with the ‘Bharat Ratan Award,’ India’s highest civilian honour.

He left for the heavenly abode on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Shillong. He was laid to rest with full state-honours and his funeral was attended by thousands of people including national-level dignitaries.
